# Project Progress Documentation:

Initial Idea:
    - I needed to recreate the application because I wanted to host the website. I noticed that 
      PHP is sort of outdated and it would be difficult to host the website with that language.
      I wanted to use something more common today, so I decided to use Flask with PHP.
    - I didn't know how to use Flask so I researched how to make a basic website with it and it 
      and I learned how to use it. I ended up recreating the MyBudget project using python and Flask.

Tech Used:
    Python:
        - main language used with all frameworks
    Flask (framework):
        - website framework for python
        - flask_login (extension)
    Jinja (framework):
        - a separate templating framework usually used with Flask
        - renders templates and its content with "{% block content %} ... {% endblock %}"
        - can pass variables with "{{ data_used }}"
    Bootstrap (framework):
        - website framework for CSS
    workzeug.security (framework):
        - extension that helps use with authenticating users

Problems and Solutions:

# -------------------------------------------------------
# Setting up the directories:
1. create the ~/website folder
2. create the ~/website/static and ~/website/templates folders
3. create the __init__.py, auth.py, models.py, and views.py folder in ~/MyBudgetV2/website
4. create the main.py outside ~/MyBudgetV2

# Directories and files explanations:
    ~/static:
        holds all javascript code, images, or css files. all files that do not change

    ~/tempates:
        holds all html code

    __init__.py:
        this file is the first thing that runs when you launch the application

    auth.py:
        contains code that routes all the files regarding user authorization

    models.py:
        used to create our database models

    views.py:
        used to render template files so they are actual webpages

    main.py:
        uses a function to create the application

# Things to know with Python and Flask:
- use the {{}} and write python code inbetween the brackets
- when using



# -------------------------------------------------------
# setting up flask:
1. install flask:
    pip install flask
2. install flask login:
    pip install flask-login
3. install flask to use with databases:
    pip install flask-sqlalchemy

# setting up the app:
1. in "__init__.py", import flask:
    from flask import Flask
2. make the method to create an app object:
    def create_app():
        app = Flask("__name__");
        app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = "123456";
        return app;

# create website routes:
1. in "views.py", create the blueprint:
    from flask import Blueprint
    views = Blueprint("views", __name__);
2. in "auth.py", create the blueprint:
    from flask import Blueprint
    auth = Blueprint("auth", __name__);
